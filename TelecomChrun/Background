The Following Folder Consists of Code for Analyzing the Churn Ratio for a Telecom Company.

About Project

In the telecom industry, customers are able to choose from multiple service providers and actively switch from one operator to another. In this highly competitive market, 
the telecommunications industry experiences an average of 15-25% annual churn rate. Given the fact that it costs 5-10 times more to acquire a new customer 
than to retain an existing one, customer retention has now become even more important than customer acquisition.


About the Implementation-
The following Activites are performed in the Code-

1) EDA 
2) Data Cleansing/Data Massaging
3) Feature Engineering.
4) Implementation of Dimensionality Reduction Technique,using PCA
5) Churn Prediction using Decision Tree
        a. Using GridSearch CV for identifying Optimal Hyperparameters.
        b. Manually Defining Ranges for Various Hyperparameters.
6) Churn Prediction Using Random Forest-
        a. Using GridSearch CV for identifying Optimal Hyperparameters.
        b. Manually Defining Ranges for Various Hyperparameters.
7) Churn Prediction using Logistic Regression,with Hyperparameter Tuning.
8) Model Evaluation
9) Identifying  Top Predictor Variables.
